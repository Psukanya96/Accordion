						Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as 
						few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to 
						let programmers write
						once, run anywhere (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without 
						the need to recompile.Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine 
						(JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer 
						low-level  facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and 
						runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was 
						one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client–server web 
						applications, with a reported 9 million developers

     				<p class="body-part">
					PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.
	 				It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is 
					now produced by The PHP Group.PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism
					PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon
					or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which
					may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP response.
					Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or 
					facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as
					standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.

						Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, 
						and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing,
	 					and CSP-style concurrency. The language is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name,, 
						but the proper name is Go
